## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   source codon-dev-env/bin/activate
   ```

2. Verify you're in the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python --version
   which python
   ```

### Running All Thread Safety Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/ -v
```

### Running Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Thread safety validation tests
python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/test_thread_safety_validation.py -v

# Performance and advanced tests
python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/test_thread_performance.py -v

# Specific test
python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/test_thread_safety_validation.py::test_thread_safety_validation_within_virtual_environment -v
```

### Running with Thread Safety Mark
```bash
python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/ -m thread_safety -v
```

## Test Results

### Expected Output
All tests should pass with output similar to:
```
tests/thread_safety/test_thread_safety_validation.py::test_thread_safety_validation_within_virtual_environment PASSED
tests/thread_safety/test_thread_safety_validation.py::test_memory_safety_concurrent_operations PASSED
tests/thread_safety/test_thread_safety_validation.py::test_concurrent_access_patterns PASSED

```

### Success Criteria

## Framework Features

### 1. Virtual Environment Integration
- Validates tests run within the correct virtual environment
- Ensures isolation from system Python installations
- Confirms Codon integration within virtual environment

### 2. Comprehensive Thread Safety Testing
- **Lock-based synchronization**: Tests proper lock usage
- **Thread isolation**: Verifies thread-local storage
- **Memory safety**: Detects memory leaks and unsafe operations
- **Deadlock prevention**: Tests deadlock detection and prevention
- **Resource management**: Validates proper cleanup

### 3. Performance Benchmarking
- Compares single-threaded vs multi-threaded performance
- Measures thread overhead and scalability
- Validates performance under concurrent load
- Tests Codon compilation performance

### 4. Production Readiness
- Tests graceful shutdown scenarios
- Validates error handling in threaded code
- Ensures proper resource cleanup
- Tests concurrent development workflows

### 5. Guidelines and Best Practices
- Comprehensive documentation of thread safety patterns
- Code examples for common scenarios
- Checklist for thread-safe development
- Common pitfalls and solutions

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Thread Safety Tests
1. Create test function with `@pytest.mark.thread_safety` decorator
2. Ensure virtual environment validation
3. Test thread isolation and memory safety
4. Include proper error handling and cleanup
5. Document test purpose and expected behavior

### Example Test Structure
```python
@pytest.mark.thread_safety
def test_new_thread_safety_feature():
    """Test description"""
    # Verify virtual environment
    python_executable = sys.executable
    assert "codon-dev-env" in python_executable
    
    # Test implementation
    # ...
    
    # Verify results
    assert expected_condition
    
    print(f"Test completed successfully")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Virtual Environment Not Activated
**Error**: `AssertionError: Not running in virtual environment`
**Solution**: Ensure virtual environment is activated:
```bash
source codon-dev-env/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Memory Leak Detection Failures
**Error**: `TypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'dict' object`
**Solution**: Use custom classes instead of dictionaries for weak references

#### 3. Test Timeouts
**Error**: Tests taking too long to complete
**Solution**: Check for infinite loops or deadlocks in test code

#### 4. Import Errors
**Error**: Module import failures in threaded context
**Solution**: Ensure all required modules are available in virtual environment

### Debugging Thread Safety Issues
1. **Enable verbose output**: Use `-v` flag for detailed test output
2. **Check thread isolation**: Verify no shared state between tests
3. **Monitor memory usage**: Use memory profiling tools
4. **Test individually**: Run specific tests to isolate issues

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Testing
The thread safety framework can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Thread Safety Tests
  run: |
    source codon-dev-env/bin/activate
    python -m pytest tests/thread_safety/ -v --tb=short
```

### Quality Gates
- All thread safety tests must pass
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- No memory leaks detected
- Virtual environment validation successful

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Thread Safety Tests**: < 5 seconds total
- **Memory Leak Detection**: < 1 second per test
- **Performance Benchmarking**: < 2 seconds
- **Codon Compilation**: < 30 seconds per compilation

### Performance Monitoring
