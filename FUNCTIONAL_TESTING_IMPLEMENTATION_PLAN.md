## Research-Driven Insights

### Key Research Findings

1. **Evaluation-First Development** (Inspired by AI Development Practices)
   - Define success criteria before implementation
   - Create "mini-contracts" between expectations and reality
   - Focus on what good output looks like in real scenarios

2. **Risk-Based Testing Prioritization**
   - Focus 80% of effort on highest-risk areas first
   - Real data reveals edge cases that synthetic data misses
   - Performance testing with realistic loads is critical

3. **Environment Consistency Requirements**

   - **Performance Thresholds**: 10 concurrent users, <50ms update latency

2. **Analytics Integration Evaluation**
   - **Success Criteria**: >90% actionable insights, enterprise-scale performance
   - **Real-World Scenario**: Team lead analyzing 5 concurrent projects
   - **Performance Thresholds**: <5s insight generation, 1000 events/second throughput

3. **Cursor IDE Integration Evaluation**
   - **Success Criteria**: Zero-configuration setup, no workflow conflicts
   - **Real-World Scenario**: Daily development across multiple projects
   - **Performance Thresholds**: <500ms startup overhead, <100MB memory footprint

### Real-World Testing Scenarios
