2. **Component Dependencies**: Authentication → Conflict Resolution → Redis Pub/Sub → GraphQL → Performance
3. **GraphQL Research**: Strawberry AsyncGenerator patterns for real-time streaming with WebSocket integration
4. **Conflict Resolution Insights**: Google Docs evolution from diff-based to operation-based transformation
5. **Redis Pub/Sub Patterns**: Multi-server coordination with channel-based message distribution
6. **Implementation Strategy**: Iterative 2-week timeline with comprehensive testing integration
7. **Quality Assurance**: Integration with Day 8 observability platform for monitoring
8. **Success Validation**: 3,400+ lines meeting enterprise-grade performance targets
