# TASK-022 Phase 2: Monitoring Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing the monitoring infrastructure that integrates with the enhanced alerting system created in Phase 1. This includes Prometheus setup, Grafana dashboards, custom metrics, and health monitoring.

## Phase 2 Architecture

### Integration with Phase 1
- **Alert Correlation Engine**: Integrate with Prometheus metrics for alert generation
- **Enhanced Notification Dispatcher**: Receive alerts from monitoring rules
- **Production Alert Rules**: Connect to actual metrics from Prometheus

### Core Components

#### 1. Prometheus Configuration & Setup (500+ lines)
- **Prometheus Server Configuration**: `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- **Custom Metrics Exporters**: Application-specific metrics collection
- **Scrape Configurations**: Service discovery and target configuration
- **Recording Rules**: Pre-computed aggregations for performance
- **Integration Points**: Connect to Phase 1 alert rules

#### 2. Grafana Dashboard Suite (800+ lines)
- **System Overview Dashboard**: High-level system health and performance
- **Application Performance Dashboard**: API metrics, response times, error rates
- **Database Monitoring Dashboard**: PostgreSQL and Redis metrics
- **Business Metrics Dashboard**: User activity, onboarding, collaboration
- **Alert Status Dashboard**: Correlation groups, escalations, notifications

#### 3. Application Metrics Integration (600+ lines)
- **FastAPI Metrics Middleware**: Request/response metrics, RED metrics
- **Custom Business Metrics**: User actions, memory operations, collaboration events
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection pool status
- **Memory System Metrics**: Graph operations, vector similarity, knowledge extraction
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Comprehensive service health monitoring

#### 4. Container & Infrastructure Metrics (400+ lines)
- **Docker Metrics**: Container resource usage and health
- **Redis Metrics**: Cache performance and usage patterns
- **PostgreSQL Metrics**: Database performance and health
- **System Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network

#### 5. Integration Layer (300+ lines)
- **Metrics Bridge**: Connect Prometheus metrics to Phase 1 alert rules
- **Alert Generation**: Transform metrics breaches into Alert objects
- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time alert status in Grafana
- **Health Check Orchestration**: Coordinate health monitoring across services

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Prometheus Infrastructure Setup
1. Create Prometheus configuration with service discovery
2. Implement custom metrics exporters for GraphMemory-IDE
3. Configure recording rules for performance optimization
4. Set up data retention and storage policies

### Step 2: Application Metrics Implementation
1. Add Prometheus metrics middleware to FastAPI
2. Implement custom business metrics collection
3. Create health check endpoints with detailed status
4. Add database and cache performance metrics

### Step 3: Grafana Dashboard Creation
1. Design and implement system overview dashboard
2. Create application performance monitoring dashboards
3. Build business metrics and user activity dashboards
4. Implement alert correlation and status dashboards

### Step 4: Integration with Phase 1 Alerting
1. Create metrics-to-alerts bridge
2. Connect Production Alert Rules to actual metrics
3. Integrate correlation engine with monitoring data
4. Test end-to-end alerting pipeline

### Step 5: Production Deployment & Testing
1. Deploy monitoring stack with Docker Compose
2. Validate metrics collection and dashboard functionality
3. Test alerting scenarios and escalation procedures
4. Document operations and troubleshooting procedures

## Expected Deliverables (2,600+ Lines Total)

### Core Files
- `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` (200 lines)
- `monitoring/prometheus/recording_rules.yml` (150 lines)
- `monitoring/grafana/dashboards/` (5 dashboards × 100-200 lines each)
- `server/monitoring/metrics_collector.py` (400 lines)
- `server/monitoring/health_checks.py` (300 lines)
- `server/monitoring/metrics_middleware.py` (200 lines)
- `server/monitoring/prometheus_integration.py` (300 lines)
- `docker/monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml` (150 lines)
- `docker/monitoring/grafana/` (Configuration files, 200 lines)

### Integration Files
- `server/monitoring/metrics_bridge.py` (250 lines)
- `server/monitoring/alert_metrics_integration.py` (200 lines)
- Updated `server/main.py` (50 lines for health endpoints)

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Prometheus collecting metrics from all services
2. ✅ Grafana dashboards providing comprehensive system visibility
3. ✅ Health checks reporting detailed service status
4. ✅ Phase 1 alerting system receiving metrics-based alerts
5. ✅ End-to-end monitoring and alerting pipeline functional
6. ✅ Production-ready monitoring stack deployed and tested

## Technical Requirements
- Prometheus 2.40+ with high availability configuration
- Grafana 9.0+ with dashboard provisioning
- Python Prometheus client library integration
- Docker Compose orchestration for monitoring stack
- Integration with existing Redis and PostgreSQL instances
- Support for horizontal scaling and load balancing

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Prometheus setup and basic metrics collection
- **Day 2**: Grafana dashboards and application metrics
- **Day 3**: Integration with Phase 1 alerting and testing

## Notes
- Focus on production-ready configuration with proper security
- Implement metrics that directly support Phase 1 alert rules
- Ensure high performance with minimal application overhead
- Create comprehensive documentation for operations team
- Design for scalability and future monitoring requirements
