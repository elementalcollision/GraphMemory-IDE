## Description
Conduct comprehensive production readiness validation for GraphMemory-IDE including end-to-end testing, security validation, performance benchmarking, disaster recovery testing, and final go-live procedures. This task ensures all production systems are working cohesively and the platform is ready for production deployment.

## Objectives
- Conduct comprehensive end-to-end production testing
- Validate all security measures and compliance requirements
- Perform load testing and performance benchmarking
- Test disaster recovery and backup procedures
- Validate monitoring and alerting systems
- Conduct security penetration testing
- Execute final go-live deployment procedures

## Steps
- [ ] Execute comprehensive end-to-end production testing
- [ ] Validate SSL certificates and security headers
- [ ] Test user onboarding and authentication flows
- [ ] Conduct load testing with realistic user scenarios
- [ ] Validate database migrations and seeding in production
- [ ] Test backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Validate monitoring dashboards and alerting systems
- [ ] Conduct security penetration testing and vulnerability scans
- [ ] Test secrets management and rotation procedures
- [ ] Validate all API endpoints and documentation
- [ ] Execute final production deployment and smoke tests
- [ ] Create production incident response runbooks

## Progress

## Notes
- Create comprehensive test scenarios covering all user journeys
- Use production-like data volumes for realistic load testing
- Document all test results and performance baselines
- Ensure all security scans pass before go-live
- Create rollback procedures in case of deployment issues
- Validate that monitoring captures all critical system events
- Test disaster recovery with actual data restoration
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations

## Next Steps
1. Design comprehensive production test scenarios
2. Set up load testing infrastructure and scenarios
3. Conduct security audits and penetration testing
4. Execute final production deployment procedures
