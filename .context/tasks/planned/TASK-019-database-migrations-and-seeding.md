## Description
Implement automated database migrations and production data seeding for GraphMemory-IDE. This includes creating database schemas, setting up migration management, implementing data seeding scripts, and ensuring database schema versioning for production deployments.

## Objectives
- Implement database migration management system
- Create comprehensive database schema definitions
- Develop production data seeding scripts
- Set up database schema versioning and rollback capabilities
- Create database initialization and upgrade procedures
- Implement database health checks and validation
- Establish database backup verification procedures

## Steps
- [ ] Implement Alembic migration management for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create initial database schema migration files
- [ ] Design and implement Kuzu graph database initialization
- [ ] Create production data seeding scripts for essential data
- [ ] Implement database version tracking and rollback procedures
- [ ] Set up automated schema validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Create database initialization scripts for fresh deployments
- [ ] Implement migration testing and validation procedures
- [ ] Set up database health monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create database upgrade and rollback documentation
- [ ] Implement automated backup validation procedures
- [ ] Test complete migration and seeding process

## Progress
Not started - awaiting completion of environment configuration

## Dependencies
- TASK-018: Production environment configuration must be complete
- PostgreSQL and Kuzu database instances must be available
- Database connection credentials must be configured

## Notes
- Use Alembic for PostgreSQL migrations following FastAPI best practices
- Implement idempotent migration scripts that can run multiple times safely
- Create separate seeding scripts for development vs production data
- Include reference data (like user roles, permissions) in production seeds
- Implement database schema validation to ensure integrity
- Consider using database transactions for atomic migrations
- Create rollback procedures for each migration in case of issues
- Implement database health checks that validate schema integrity

## Next Steps
1. Set up Alembic configuration and initial migration
2. Create comprehensive database schema definitions
3. Implement production data seeding framework
4. Test migration and rollback procedures
