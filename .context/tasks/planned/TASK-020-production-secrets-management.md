## Description
Implement comprehensive production secrets management for GraphMemory-IDE including JWT signing keys, API keys, database credentials, and certificate management. This includes secure storage, rotation procedures, and proper secrets injection for production deployments.

## Objectives
- Implement secure JWT key generation and rotation
- Set up secure API key management system
- Configure secure database credential management
- Implement certificate storage and rotation procedures
- Set up environment-specific secrets management
- Create secrets validation and monitoring system
- Establish secrets backup and recovery procedures

## Steps
- [ ] Generate and configure production JWT signing keys
- [ ] Implement JWT key rotation procedures and automation
- [ ] Set up secure API key generation and management
- [ ] Configure database credential encryption and storage
- [ ] Implement SSL certificate management and auto-renewal
- [ ] Set up production environment secrets injection
- [ ] Create secrets validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Implement secrets monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Set up encrypted secrets backup procedures
- [ ] Create secrets rotation documentation and procedures
- [ ] Implement secrets audit logging and compliance
- [ ] Test complete secrets management lifecycle

## Progress
Not started - awaiting completion of environment configuration

## Dependencies
- TASK-018: Production environment configuration must be complete
- Production infrastructure must support secure secrets storage
- SSL certificates must be available for encryption

## Notes
- Use environment variables for secrets injection, never hardcode
- Implement proper key rotation schedules (JWT keys monthly, API keys quarterly)
- Use strong encryption for secrets at rest (AES-256 minimum)
- Consider using HashiCorp Vault or similar for enterprise secrets management
- Implement proper secrets access logging and audit trails
- Use separate secrets for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Implement secrets validation on application startup
- Create automated backup procedures for critical secrets

## Next Steps
1. Generate initial production JWT signing keys
2. Set up secrets management infrastructure
3. Implement secrets rotation automation
4. Create secrets monitoring and alerting
