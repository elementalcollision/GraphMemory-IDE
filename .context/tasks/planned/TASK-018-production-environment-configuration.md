## Description
Configure production environment settings, SSL certificates, domain setup, and production-specific configurations for GraphMemory-IDE. This includes setting up secure communication protocols, proper environment variables, and production-grade security headers.

## Objectives
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS communication
- Configure production domain settings and DNS
- Implement production environment variables and secrets management
- Enable security headers and CORS policies for production
- Configure production-specific FastAPI settings
- Set up production-grade logging and error handling

## Steps
- [ ] Generate and configure SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
- [ ] Set up production domain DNS configuration
- [ ] Create production environment configuration files
- [ ] Configure HTTPS redirect and security headers middleware
- [ ] Set up production-specific CORS policies
- [ ] Configure production database connection strings
- [ ] Set up production Redis configuration
- [ ] Configure production logging levels and formats
- [ ] Implement production error handling and monitoring
- [ ] Test SSL certificate validation and renewal
- [ ] Validate security headers with security scanners
- [ ] Document production deployment procedures

## Progress
Not started - awaiting task prioritization

## Dependencies
- Docker configuration must be complete
- Domain registration and DNS access required
- Production server infrastructure must be available

## Code Context
- file: server/main.py
  relevance: 0.9
  sections: [1-50]
  reason: "Main FastAPI application configuration that needs production settings"
- file: docker-compose.production.yml
  relevance: 0.8
  sections: [all]
  reason: "Production docker configuration file"
- file: server/core/config.py
  relevance: 0.9
  sections: [all]
  reason: "Configuration management that needs production environment settings"
- file: server/middleware/
  relevance: 0.8
  sections: [all]
  reason: "Middleware components for security headers and HTTPS enforcement"

## Notes
- Use environment-specific configuration patterns from FastAPI best practices
- Implement proper secrets management (never commit secrets to git)
- Consider using Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for production
- SSL certificate auto-renewal should be automated (certbot for Let's Encrypt)
- Security headers should include HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- Follow OWASP security guidelines for production deployments

## Next Steps
1. Research domain and SSL certificate requirements
2. Set up production environment file structure
3. Configure security middleware and headers
4. Test SSL configuration with security tools
