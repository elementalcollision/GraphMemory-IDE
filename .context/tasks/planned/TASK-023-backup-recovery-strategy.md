## Description
Implement a comprehensive automated backup and disaster recovery strategy for GraphMemory-IDE. This includes automated database backups, file system backups, point-in-time recovery, backup validation, and complete disaster recovery procedures with testing protocols.

## Objectives
- Implement automated PostgreSQL and Redis backup procedures
- Set up Kuzu graph database backup and restoration
- Configure point-in-time recovery (PITR) capabilities
- Create automated backup validation and integrity checks
- Implement cross-region backup replication for disaster recovery
- Set up backup monitoring and alerting systems
- Design and test complete disaster recovery procedures

## Steps
- [ ] Configure automated PostgreSQL backups with pg_dump and WAL archiving
- [ ] Set up Redis automated backup with RDB and AOF persistence
- [ ] Implement Kuzu graph database backup and export procedures
- [ ] Configure point-in-time recovery with WAL-G or similar tools
- [ ] Set up automated backup encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Implement cross-region backup replication (S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
- [ ] Create backup validation and integrity verification scripts
- [ ] Set up backup monitoring with metrics and alerts
- [ ] Design disaster recovery runbooks and procedures
- [ ] Implement automated disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Create backup retention policies and lifecycle management
- [ ] Test complete backup and recovery scenarios

## Progress
Not started - awaiting completion of database setup and monitoring

## Dependencies
- TASK-019: Database systems must be fully operational
- TASK-022: Monitoring system must be ready for backup alerts
- Cloud storage or backup infrastructure must be available
- Network connectivity to backup storage locations required

## Notes
- Implement 3-2-1 backup strategy (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite)
- Use automated backup testing to ensure recoverability
- Implement backup encryption both in transit and at rest
- Consider using cloud-native backup services for reliability
- Set up proper backup retention (daily for 30 days, weekly for 12 weeks, monthly for 1 year)
- Implement backup compression to reduce storage costs
- Create detailed disaster recovery time objectives (RTO) and point objectives (RPO)
- Test disaster recovery procedures regularly with automated testing

## Next Steps
1. Set up automated database backup procedures
2. Implement backup validation and integrity checking
3. Configure disaster recovery testing automation
4. Create comprehensive disaster recovery documentation
