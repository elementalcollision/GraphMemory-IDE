## Description
Implement a comprehensive production monitoring and alerting system for GraphMemory-IDE using Prometheus, Grafana, and custom health checks. This includes application metrics, infrastructure monitoring, custom dashboards, and automated alerting for critical system events.

## Objectives
- Set up Prometheus metrics collection and storage
- Configure Grafana dashboards for system observability
- Implement custom application health checks and metrics
- Create automated alerting for critical system events
- Set up log aggregation and analysis
- Configure performance monitoring and bottleneck detection
- Implement uptime monitoring and SLA tracking

## Steps
- [ ] Install and configure Prometheus for metrics collection
- [ ] Set up Grafana with custom dashboards for GraphMemory-IDE
- [ ] Implement FastAPI metrics and health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure database performance monitoring (PostgreSQL/Redis)
- [ ] Set up application-specific metrics (collaboration, memory operations)
- [ ] Create custom alerts for critical system thresholds
- [ ] Implement log aggregation with structured logging
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring and external health checks
- [ ] Set up performance profiling and bottleneck detection
- [ ] Create incident response and escalation procedures
- [ ] Implement SLA monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Test alerting scenarios and response procedures

## Progress
Not started - awaiting completion of production environment setup

## Dependencies
- TASK-018: Production environment must be configured
- TASK-019: Database systems must be operational
- Production infrastructure must support monitoring stack
- Email/notification services must be available for alerts

## Notes
- Use Prometheus best practices for metric naming and labels
- Implement RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) for all services
- Create both technical and business metrics dashboards
- Set up alert fatigue prevention with proper thresholds and grouping
- Implement graceful degradation monitoring for collaborative features
- Use structured logging (JSON format) for better log analysis
- Consider implementing distributed tracing for complex collaboration flows
- Create runbooks for common alerting scenarios and incident response

## Next Steps
1. Set up Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack
2. Implement application health checks and custom metrics
3. Create comprehensive dashboards for system observability
4. Configure automated alerting and incident response
