## Description
Implement advanced production features for GraphMemory-IDE including intelligent rate limiting, comprehensive usage analytics, Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, advanced security features, and enterprise-grade functionality to enhance the platform's production readiness and user experience.

## Objectives
- Implement intelligent rate limiting with user-aware policies
- Set up comprehensive usage analytics and user behavior tracking
- Configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML/OAuth2 providers
- Implement advanced security features (2FA, IP whitelisting)
- Create usage reporting and business intelligence dashboards
- Set up A/B testing infrastructure for feature rollouts
- Implement advanced collaboration features and permissions

## Steps
- [ ] Design and implement intelligent rate limiting system
- [ ] Set up Redis-based rate limiting with user context awareness
- [ ] Implement comprehensive analytics tracking system
- [ ] Configure Google Analytics/Mixpanel integration for user behavior
- [ ] Set up SSO integration with SAML and OAuth2 providers
- [ ] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA) system
- [ ] Create IP whitelisting and geo-blocking capabilities
- [ ] Set up usage reporting and business intelligence dashboards
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework for feature flags
- [ ] Create advanced collaboration permissions and workflows
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning and vulnerability monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance optimization and caching strategies

## Progress
Not started - awaiting completion of core production features

## Dependencies
- TASK-021: User onboarding must be complete for analytics tracking
- TASK-022: Monitoring system must be ready for rate limiting metrics
- Redis infrastructure must be available for rate limiting
- SSO provider integrations must be configured

## Notes
- Use sliding window rate limiting for better user experience
- Implement context-aware rate limiting (different limits for different user types)
- Ensure analytics tracking is GDPR/CCPA compliant with proper consent
- Support multiple SSO providers (Google, Microsoft, Okta, Auth0)
- Implement proper 2FA with TOTP and backup codes
- Create comprehensive audit logs for security compliance
- Use feature flags for safe rollout of new advanced features
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation

## Next Steps
1. Design intelligent rate limiting architecture
2. Set up analytics tracking infrastructure
3. Implement SSO integration with major providers
4. Create advanced security and monitoring features
