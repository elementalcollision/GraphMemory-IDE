## üé® **Technical Innovation Highlights**

### **Graph-Specific OT Algorithms**
```python
def transform_against(self, other: 'RelationshipOperation') -> 'RelationshipOperation':
    """Transform this operation against another concurrent operation"""
    if not self.is_concurrent_with(other):
        return self  # No transformation needed
    
    # Handle CREATE vs CREATE conflicts with user priority
    if (self.operation_type == RelationshipOperationType.CREATE and 
        other.operation_type == RelationshipOperationType.CREATE):
        if self.user_id < other.user_id:
            return self  # This operation wins
        else:
            return self._create_no_op()  # Convert to no-op
```

### **Bidirectional Relationship Management**
```python
def get_relationship_id(self) -> str:
    """Generate consistent relationship ID from source and target"""
    memory_ids = sorted([self.source_memory_id, self.target_memory_id])
    return f"rel_{memory_ids[0]}_{memory_ids[1]}"
```

### **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**
```python
def _transform_modify_metadata_against(self, other: 'RelationshipOperation') -> 'RelationshipOperation':
    """Transform MODIFY_METADATA operation against another operation"""
    if other.operation_type == RelationshipOperationType.MODIFY_METADATA:
        # Both modifying metadata - merge the changes
        merged_metadata = {**other.metadata, **self.metadata}
        transformed.metadata = merged_metadata
        return transformed
```
