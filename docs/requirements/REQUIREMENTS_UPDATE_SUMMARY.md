## Installation Instructions

### For Full Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### For Codon Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements-codon.txt
```

### For Component-Specific Development
```bash
# Dashboard
pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt

# Monitoring
pip install -r monitoring/requirements.txt
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Installation**: Run the validation script to ensure all dependencies install correctly
