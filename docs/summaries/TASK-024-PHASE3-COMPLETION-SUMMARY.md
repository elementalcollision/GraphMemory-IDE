## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Database Schema**
- **7 New Tables Created:**
  - `dashboards` - Dashboard configurations and metadata
  - `alerts` - Alert rules and configurations  
  - `active_alerts` - Current active alerts
  - `real_time_metrics` - Live metric storage
  - `user_journeys` - Session-based user journey tracking
  - `alert_rules` - Alert rule definitions
  - `analytics_events` - Extended event storage

### **Dependencies Successfully Integrated**
- ‚úÖ **Plotly 5.17.0** - Interactive data visualizations
- ‚úÖ **Pandas 2.2.0** - Data processing and analytics  
- ‚úÖ **WebSockets 12.0** - Real-time communication
- ‚úÖ **HTTPx 0.25.2** - Webhook notifications
- ‚úÖ All packages installed and verified in production

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Proper database indexing for analytical queries
- JSON/JSONB storage for flexible configuration
- Background processing for heavy analytical operations
- Redis caching for real-time metrics
- WebSocket connection management for live updates

## üîß LINTER ISSUES RESOLUTION

### **Issues Fixed Successfully:**
‚úÖ **Dataclass Type Annotations** - Replaced `asdict()` calls with explicit dictionary construction  
‚úÖ **Plotly Dictionary Creation** - Fixed marker and layout dictionary syntax  
‚úÖ **Analytics Engine Integration** - Corrected `track_event()` method interface  
‚úÖ **Optional Parameter Types** - Fixed `None` default parameters with proper `Optional` typing  
‚úÖ **Pandas Operations** - Fixed `reset_index()` and aggregation method calls

### **Remaining Issues (Non-Critical):**
- Minor whitespace and formatting inconsistencies (W291, W293)
- Unused import statements (can be cleaned up in optimization phase)
- Line length formatting (style preferences)

**Impact:** These are purely cosmetic and do not affect functionality.
