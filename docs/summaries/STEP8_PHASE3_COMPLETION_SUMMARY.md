### 2. Alert Lifecycle Management

**State Machine Implementation**:
```python
class AlertState(str, Enum):
    CREATED = "created"
    ACKNOWLEDGED = "acknowledged"
    INVESTIGATING = "investigating"
    ESCALATED = "escalated"
    RESOLVED = "resolved"
    CLOSED = "closed"
    ARCHIVED = "archived"
```

**Lifecycle Operations**:
- **create_alert()**: Create and persist new alerts with immediate escalation check

- **resolve_alert()**: Resolution with time tracking and notification
- **escalate_alert()**: Multi-level escalation with policy enforcement
- **bulk_acknowledge()**: Efficient bulk operations for multiple alerts
- **bulk_resolve()**: Batch resolution with comprehensive tracking

### 3. Escalation Engine

**Policy-Driven Escalation**:
```python
class EscalationRule:
    - Severity-based escalation thresholds
    - Time-based escalation triggers
    - Maximum escalation limits
    - Configurable escalation intervals
    - Multiple escalation targets
```

**Default Escalation Policies**:
- **CRITICAL**: 5-minute threshold, 3 max escalations, 15-minute intervals
- **HIGH**: 15-minute threshold, 2 max escalations, 30-minute intervals
- **MEDIUM**: 60-minute threshold, 1 max escalation, 60-minute intervals

### 4. Persistence & State Management

**SQLite Database Features**:
```python
# Complete alert persistence
- Full alert lifecycle tracking
- State transition history
- User action audit trail

- Performance-optimized queries
```

**Memory Management**:
- In-memory cache for fast access (configurable limit: 10,000 alerts)
- Automatic archival of old resolved alerts (30-day retention)
- Background cleanup of memory-resident data
- Efficient query patterns for large datasets

### 5. Background Monitoring

**Automated Tasks**:
```python
# Escalation Monitor
- Continuous monitoring of alert age
- Policy-based automatic escalation

- Database maintenance tasks
- Performance monitoring
```

## üîó Integration Architecture

### NotificationDispatcher Integration
```python
async def acknowledge_alert(self, alert_id: str, acknowledged_by: str):
    # Update alert state
    self._alert_states[alert_id] = AlertState.ACKNOWLEDGED
    
    # Trigger notification
    await self.notification_dispatcher.dispatch_alert(alert)
    
    # Event callbacks
    await self._trigger_state_change_callbacks(alert_id, AlertState.ACKNOWLEDGED)
```

**Integration Points**:
- **Automatic Notifications**: State changes trigger notification dispatch
- **Event Callbacks**: Extensible callback system for custom integrations
- **Delivery Tracking**: Coordination with notification delivery metrics
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient operation during notification failures

### Analytics & Metrics

**Real-time Metrics**:
```python
class AlertMetrics:
    - Total/active/resolved/acknowledged/escalated alert counts
    - Average resolution and acknowledgment times
    - Alerts by severity, category, and state
    - Resolution time analytics
    - System health indicators
```
